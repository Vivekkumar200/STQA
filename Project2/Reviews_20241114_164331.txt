Review: Purchase it on 10 Feb 2021 and it's 7 Dec. 2021. 10 months of long usage for more than 6 hrs daily here is my review1. Build quality- It's good for the price very good build but can break if fall or someone sits on it though build quality is great  I am using it very civil manner üòú so mine one is absolutely fine.2. Noise cancellation- It's just a gimmick do not purchase for noise cancellation they do normal passive noise cancelation but this shouldn't be your purchasing decision for this headphone.3. Bluetooth connectivity- It works absolutely perfect for Mobile, Tab, and smart TV- But with my PC it gets little connectivity issues but that's only for 1 out of 10 times but its Okay as I used it with Aux now Because my usage is high4. Battery- It was by buying decision for this headphone I purchase it for my online classes as I need great battery life and this headphone done this job absolutely perfect I got 17-18 hours of battery on the usage at sound 70% and its great believe me big battery life is must for any Bluetooth device and it's been 10 months now it's the battery is degraded as I was heavy user now it gives around 13-15 hour. so I recommend to use it with AUX if you are going to use it for a very long period it will save your battery5. Sound quality- I purchase it for battery life and I thought sound quality will be okay and it doesn't matter to me as I will be using it for classes but I was wrong the sound quality is soo good u will find this level of sound quality in the expensive headphone for the sound quality it's 10/10.6. Now some prons that pissed me of- It got an issue only with PC while connecting I have to connect and disconnect more than 3 times. but there can be Issues with my PC also IDK because this problem only happen with PC only work fine on another device- After connecting it with AUX headphone buttons and the mic doesn't work it only works on Bluetooth mode and it totally ruins the experience with AUX u can only use it for listening with AUX, not for Video calls, normal calls, and online multiplayer game Like pubg as mic doesn't work so U have to connect it Bluetooth to unlock all these features- U can't use it in summers if u have no AC in your room U will end up with lots of sweat if You use It so consider this also because If you're going to use it in a room without AC and u are living in a city like Delhi then don't purchase it.

Review: Personal Feedback: I didn't like the build quality at all. The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage. Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;)Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life spanCushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie üç™!

Review: At first you may think - what the hell is this !! But day by day when you will use it , slowly you will fall in love with it.Anyway, product is very good. Specially vocals are soo cristal clear. Bass is not over powerd but sufficient to enjoy. It's comfortable for ears also.Update : after 14 days of normal uses I'm going to charge it first time.

Review: The sound is alright but there is no bass at all so if you're buying for that then don't. I expected a lil bit of bass but it had no at all so it was quite disappointing. Other than that battery life is fine.
